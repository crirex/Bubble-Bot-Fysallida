Fysallida may randomly play with bubbles when she is not used for a while.
She may respond to "Greetings" and "Farewells" (Maybe even start them when someone comes online.)

# +introduction

Hi ^^, my name is Fysallida and I am a shy and small bubble bot. I go from a device to another and create bubbles of all 
sizes. I generate them by hacking into 3D-Printers or by using some of my magic to blow bubbles 
directly out of the monitor or TV (phone screens too, but they are way harder to blow through :confounded: ). The bubbles 
I generate are super resistant and can be made out of soap, rubber, plastic or gum (glass too, but those make a 
dangerous mess when they break :pensive: ) and I can control them at my will to play with somebody :3 .
If you want to know how to use me just type "+help" and I'll be sure to help.

# +help

### --- Legend --- ###

-> -> definition

\+ -> it's the command you write so that i can know you want to use ME, I mean acces my functions.

[] -> is a field you are required to fill. ( You dont need to put the [] when writing the function ).

{} -> is a field you are not required to fill. ( You dont need to put the {} when writing the function ).

() -> comments

### --- The following commands exist for your use --- ###

+help -> Shows you all my commands...again.

+introduction -> I will itroduce myself :blush:

+bubble {@Name | Name} {Soap | Rubber | Gum | Plastic | Glass} {Trap | Squish | Sit} -> This command will be used so that i could use 
my powers to create bubbles and use them to play with someone. If you dont pick anything in a field then I will just do random things.

+art -> Will randomly show a bubble art from my archive ( This should be updated daily, but it's not implemented at the moment. )

+story -> Will randomly write a bubble story from my archive ( Again, like the above, but this could be harder or easier to implement. )

+music [url / name] -> Well like any other bot I should be able to play some music as well. ( I guess it will only be from youtube, but who knows. )

Thanks for using me and have a bubbly day :smile: .
